Math IRL: a Virtual Reality 3D Graphing function

How the project works is simple:

-The user inputs a function in index.html

-index.html redirects to main_page.html, sending the function information.

-The function is parsed and a grid of points is created.

-The grid of points is transformed into Mesh, a 3D model.

-With the help of ar.js, the 3D model is displayed on the tracker.
(Note: the functionality of the above three is all contained in grapher_and_ar.js)

And it's really that simple!
